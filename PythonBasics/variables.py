# Using the variables with the print method will make
# The below text much easier.
print("Hello, world")
print("Hello, my name is Jon. I am a Python developer.")

# Here is where we start to use variables
greeting = "Hello, "
firstName = "Jonathan"  # Here you can input your own name to see what happens

## Welcome to Python with Jon.
Welcome to Python with Jon. In this course I will be teaching you how to program. You will learn the Python programming language. You may be asking why Python? Well Python is one of the fastest growing programming laguages. If you look at GitHub you will see that Python ranks in top 3 programming languages for repositories. If you are new to proramming and are unsure of what GitHub is don't worry we will cover how to use git as well as pushing our code up to a GitHub repository. 

## What this course aims to teach:

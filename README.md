## Welcome to Python with Jon.
Welcome to Python with Jon. In this course I will be teaching you how to program. You will learn the Python programming language. You may be asking why Python? Well Python is one of the fastest growing programming laguages. If you look at GitHub you will see that Python ranks in top 3 programming languages for repositories. If you are new to proramming and are unsure of what GitHub is don't worry we will cover how to use git as well as pushing our code up to a GitHub repository. 

## What this course aims to teach:
This course aims to teach the basics of the Python programming language. I know you're thinking "Oh great another Python beginner course". What I think sets my course apart from the rest is that I aim to teach you the language by covering multiple aspects of what the language can do. 

> * Text Editor/IDE
> * Variables
> * Comments
> * Numbers
> * Functions
> * Data Types
>    1. Lists
>    2. Tuples
>    3. Sets
>    4. Dictionaries
> * Game creation
> * Web Development

And so much more. 

# How to start:
First off you will start by cloning this repository. Open a terminal/powershell/cmd prompt and type the following commands in. You will need to hit enter after each command to run the command.

```
cd Desktop
git clone https://github.com/RedHoodJT1988/pythonwithjon.git
cd pythonwithjon
code .
```

This will change your directory to the Desktop, you will then clone my repo to your computer, next you will change directory(cd) to the newly cloned repo pythonwithjon, and finally the `code .` opens the contents of the repo within Visual Studio Code.

If you are using another text editor that you are more comfortable with then please replace the steps with opening the repo in your text editor. If you aren't comfortable with the command prompt/terminal don't worry you can click and drag your the repo folder on to VS Code. This is covered in the first few lecture vidoes. 

I hope you enjoy the course and I look forward to seeing the awesome things you create once you are finished.
